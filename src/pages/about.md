I’m Nadun Lakshan, a Software Engineering undergraduate at SLIIT.

I build and automate reliable systems, and I’m especially comfortable in Linux environments (Ubuntu/Amazon Linux). I also enjoy the Windows GUI—my current setup is Windows + WSL (Ubuntu 22.04).

I'm a tool-oriented developer with extensive knowledge of tools. I excel at quickly finding, testing, and integrating free online tools to boost my productivity.
